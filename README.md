Fee Estimator
=============

Produces a fee estimate for an FOI request based on the amount of responsive records and a review of a sample of these records.

This project is primarily to practice what I've learned from Sandi Metz's excellent, "Practical Object Oriented-esign in Ruby", but it's solving a real problem associated with my day job as and Access and Privacy Analyst.

Status
------

In active development.

Caveats
-------

In reality, I wouldn't write a command line application to solve this problem for clients working in FOI, but since this is a learning project, I wanted to keep things simple so I could focus on the business objects. And I also wanted to create my first gem. This code *could* see real world use if it was imported into a larger project, such as an FOI case management system.
